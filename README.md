# AJAX-Requester and File-Uploader

A tiny ajax-class for GET,POST-request and a file-uploader with limiting. You may upload gif,png or jpeg-pictures with limited filesize. It's only a spin-off out of a bigger project and may grow in the future. Only the empty folder "upload" is missing. Don't forget to chmod it for the script-writing.

Here you'll find a sandbox-demo: http://cbmhardware.de/ajax/ 
Filesize is limited to one byte - you know. ;) 

Hope it's useful.
